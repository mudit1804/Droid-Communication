# Droid-Communication
There are two droids on two different systems. figuring This python script helps to synchronize data between a folder on one device (say device A) which is of droid 1 and a folder on another device (say device B) which is of droid 2. In addition to that, a change made to the data on one device should also be made  available to the other device as well.
